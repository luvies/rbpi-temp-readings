# RBPi Temperature Readings
This is a personal project that I'm making for my step-dad. It provides a server and client that can be used to store sensor data and historical readings.

## Server
- Node.js
- TypeScript
- Express.js
- TypeORM

Default database: sql.js.

## Client
- React
- TypeScript & TSX
